# Approach 2: Optimized Space Solution

This is an advanced approach where we reduce the space complexity.

In the previous approach, we used extra row and column arrays to keep track of which rows and columns should be zeroed. Here, we use the first row of the matrix as the column marker array, and the first column as the row marker array.

However, this introduces a problem: how do we store the information for the first row and first column themselves?  
This information cannot be stored in a single element (i.e., $E_{00}$).  
So, we use two separate variables, `row0` and `col0`, to store whether the first row or first column should be zeroed.

**Steps:**

1. Traverse the first row of the matrix. If there's any `0`, mark `row0` as `true`.
2. Traverse the first column of the matrix. If there's any `0`, mark `col0` as `true`.
3. Traverse the rest of the matrix (excluding the first row and first column):
    - If element $E_{ij} = 0$, set `matrix[0][j] = 0` and `matrix[i][0] = 0`.
4. Traverse the rows (excluding the first row):
    - If `matrix[i][0] == 0`, set the entire $i^{th}$ row to `0`.
5. Traverse the columns (excluding the first column):
    - If `matrix[0][j] == 0`, set the entire $j^{th}$ column to `0`.
6. Finally, if `row0` is `true`, set the entire first row to `0`.
7. If `col0` is `true`, set the entire first column to `0`.

**Comments on Approach & Edge Cases:**

- The approach is correct and is the standard way to achieve O(1) extra space for this problem.
- **Edge Cases to Consider:**
  - If the first row or first column contains a `0`, ensure you do not overwrite the marker information before using it.
  - Be careful with the order of operations: update the rest of the matrix first, then handle the first row and column at the end.
  - If the matrix is only 1 row or 1 column, the logic should still work, but test these cases to be sure.
- **No major mistakes** in the described approach. Just ensure careful implementation, especially with the first row and column handling.
